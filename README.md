# Basic-Calculator
A basic calculator that performs simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. The HTML file contains the basic structure of the project. I have used a nested div tag to develop a calculator like structure. The height, width, color, alignment, and all the other appearance-related things are adding using external CSS. The actual calculation of the calculator in performed in a JavaScript file using the eval() function property. Both the CSS and JavaScript files are linked with the HTML file and together all these files work as a fully functioning calculator.
